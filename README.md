# CPP Crash Course

This repository contains my completed exercises from the book 
[C++ Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/C-Crash-Course-Josh-Lospinoso/dp/1593278888)

I am reading this book to refresh my stale C++ knowledge for game and systems development.

# Disclaimer

This repository is not representative of my C/C++ coding style. The exercises in this repo are simplified and truncated for
brevity in refreshing C/C++ concepts. Corners will be cut, there is inconsistency everywhere and bugs will be created.
